//RECAPS

//to analyze the performance of an algorithm, we use BIG O Notation- it has to do with big, high level big picture trends as the size of an input grows
// we want to know of the run times changes or how the space complexity changes.

// Big O can give us a high level understanding of time or space complexity of an algorithm

//Big O notation doesn't care about precision, only about general trends(linear? quadratic? contant?)

// the time or space cpmplexity(as measured by Big O) depends only on the algorithm, not the hardware used to run the algorithm
